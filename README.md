# QuantLab Research

QuantLab Research is a local-first quantitative lab for reproducible research, disciplined paper validation, and supervised execution.

It is built on QuantLab Core, the internal engine that makes hypotheses, configurations, runs, artifacts, and outcomes explicit, traceable, and reviewable. The goal is not narrative polish, but research clarity, operational discipline, and controlled progression from validation to execution.

Brand architecture:

- QuantLab is the umbrella ecosystem
- QuantLab Research is the public-facing research product
- QuantLab Core is the internal engine and validation layer
- QuantPulse is a sibling signal product in the same ecosystem

Today, the ecosystem should be read as:

- a sovereign QuantLab Research app for research, paper ops, and execution discipline
- a distinct QuantPulse product for signal, context, and prioritization
- moving toward practical onchain and broker-connected trading operation
- still intentionally supervised, not yet broad autonomous live routing

It is intentionally governed without an external orchestration product:

- QuantLab Research is the primary system for research, paper-trading discipline, execution safety, and future broker-connected operation.
- QuantLab Core remains the quantitative, execution, and evidence authority.
- AI assistance may support analysis, planning, explanation, and code work, but it has no execution authority.

The architectural rule is simple:

- QuantLab Research remains autonomous
- critical approval remains human
- local Python workflows are the current lightweight orchestration baseline
- any external consumer must use explicit maintained contracts and must not become product authority

QuantPulse is a separate sibling product:

- it can feed QuantLab Research with prioritized research intents, regime filters, and product hints
- QuantLab Research should only consume those signals when they improve research, validation, risk control, or product priorities
- the intake contract is documented in [docs/quant-pulse-quantlab-contract.md](./docs/quant-pulse-quantlab-contract.md)

## Current Status

QuantLab Research is currently transitioning from a strong paper-operations base into **Stage D.2 - supervised broker submit safety and reconciliation**.

The paper layer is now materially operational, and the current broker-facing focus is:

- reconcile the first supervised Hyperliquid submit path before widening live execution
- close idempotency and ambiguous-submit gaps before adding more broker power
- keep paper-session discipline as a prerequisite, not as the current bottleneck

Execution venue strategy note:

- `Hyperliquid` is the active execution venue direction
- `Kraken` remains implemented compatibility / history, not the active next target
- `Bitget` is a later optional comparison venue, after Hyperliquid, not the next default target
- public positioning should describe QuantLab as a local-first quantitative research and supervised execution system with support for modern execution venues, including web3-native venues
- `BrokerAdapter` remains the current code name, but the architecture should now be read as an execution-venue boundary, not only a CEX-style broker boundary
- a minimal `ExecutionContext` layer now exists in code so future venue work can model signer and routing semantics without overloading `ExecutionIntent`
- local signer-backed Hyperliquid action signing, supervised submit artifacts, canonical submit sessions, direct post-submit status, richer fill/close reconciliation, a bounded continuous-supervision surface, and a first supervised cancel boundary now exist

A secondary boundary track remains active:

- stable `run` and `sweep` behavior
- stable `report.json.machine_contract`
- automatic refresh of `outputs/runs/runs_index.*`
- reliable health/version surfaces via `--check` and `--version`
- stable desktop v0.1foundation with hardened structural layout (sidebar/nav) and graceful local-only fallback support when API surfaces are unreachable.

External-consumer contract work remains subordinate to QuantLab Research-owned priorities.
QuantPulse-facing intake is also subordinate to QuantLab Research-owned priorities and should only be used when it produces testable research or clear product value.

## Brand

See [docs/brand-guidelines.md](./docs/brand-guidelines.md) for the public brand architecture, voice, and visual direction for QuantLab Research.

Known technical debt still tracked internally:

- duplicate workflow docs in `.agents/workflows/`: `strategy-research.md` vs `strategy_research.md`
- native acceleration is now explicitly treated as a measured hotspot decision, not as a language-rewrite goal

## Requirements

- Windows 11 or Ubuntu
- Python 3.10+
- Git

Documented support starts at Python 3.10. The recommended target remains Python 3.11 or 3.12.
As of 2026-03-25, the local CLI preflight in this repository also passes on Python 3.13.3.

## Clean Installation

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd quant_lab
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Developer dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Optional performance extras:

```bash
pip install -e .[perf]
```

Local credentials:

- QuantLab loads a root `.env` automatically on startup
- use [`.env.example`](./.env.example) as the template
- keep unused secrets blank rather than filling placeholder text
- the first supervised evidence check expects:
  - `KRAKEN_API_KEY`
  - `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`
  - `HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - `HYPERLIQUID_ACCOUNT` or `HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS`
  - `HYPERLIQUID_SIGNER_ID` when using `api_wallet` or `agent_wallet`

## Quickstart (v0.1 Workflow)

**QuantLab Research v0.1 is a local-first workstation for launching, inspecting, and reviewing real runs through a stable desktop shell.**

The recommended way to explore the product is via the native desktop shell:

1. **Setup**: Ensure your local virtual environment is active (`pip install -e .`).
2. **Launch**: 
   ```powershell
   cd desktop
   npm install  # only first time
   npm start
   ```
3. **Explore**:
   - **System**: Verify local telemetry and bridge connectivity.
   - **Runs**: Survey indexed history and open detailed artifacts.
   - **Compare**: Rank shortlisted candidates based on canonical metrics.

### Operational Notes & Warnings

- **Local-first Design**: v0.1 is optimized for local workstation usage and may display local-only or runtime fallback states depending on your environment setup.
- **Surface Availability**: Transitional or optional local surfaces may appear offline or detached; this is intended behavior and does not block the primary QuantLab inspection and research flow.
- **Native Priority**: The canonical v0.1 experience is the native desktop inspection workstation. Browser-backed transitional surfaces are preserved but demoted to legacy fallback.

*Note: For detailed boundaries and known limitations, see [docs/v0.1-scope.md](./docs/v0.1-scope.md).*

## Real CLI Usage

### Run

Single research run:

```bash
python main.py --ticker ETH-USD --start 2022-01-01 --end 2023-12-31 --report
```

This produces a canonical research run directory under:

```text
outputs/runs/<run_id>/
```

Paper-backed run:

```bash
python main.py --ticker ETH-USD --start 2022-01-01 --end 2023-12-31 --paper --report
```

This produces a canonical paper session directory under:

```text
outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>/
```

### Runs

List all runs:

```bash
python main.py --runs-list outputs/runs
```

Show one run:

```bash
python main.py --runs-show outputs/runs/20260324_005008_run_a468850
```

Best run by metric:

```bash
python main.py --runs-best outputs/runs --metric sharpe_simple
```

### Paper Sessions

List paper sessions:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-list outputs/paper_sessions
```

Show one paper session:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-show outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>
```

Summarize paper session health:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-health outputs/paper_sessions
```

Emit a paper-session alert snapshot:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-alerts outputs/paper_sessions --paper-stale-minutes 60
```

Refresh the shared paper-session index:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-index outputs/paper_sessions
```

- see [docs/supervised-broker-runbook.md](./docs/supervised-broker-runbook.md) for the current happy-path and failure-path guidance over supervised Kraken and Hyperliquid corridors

### Forward

Forward evaluation from a prior grid/walkforward run directory:

```bash
python main.py --forward-eval outputs/runs/<grid_or_walkforward_run_id> --forward-start 2024-01-01 --forward-end 2024-06-01 --forward-outdir outputs/forward_runs/fwd_demo
```

Resume a previous forward session:

```bash
python main.py --resume-forward outputs/forward_runs/<session_id>
```

### Portfolio

Aggregate forward sessions:

```bash
python main.py --portfolio-report outputs/forward_runs
```

Compare allocation modes:

```bash
python main.py --portfolio-compare outputs/forward_runs
```

Portfolio selection and weighting example:

```bash
python main.py --portfolio-report outputs/forward_runs --portfolio-mode custom_weight --portfolio-weights path/to/weights.json --portfolio-top-n 5 --portfolio-rank-metric total_return
```

## Canonical Artifact Structure

Canonical research run artifacts are centered on:

```text
outputs/runs/<run_id>/
  metadata.json
  config.json
  metrics.json
  report.json
  run_report.md
  trades.csv                 # optional
  artifacts/                 # optional
```

Canonical paper session artifacts are centered on:

```text
outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>/
  session_metadata.json
  session_status.json
  config.json
  metrics.json
  report.json
  run_report.md
  trades.csv
  artifacts/
```

Shared paper-session index artifacts:

```text
outputs/paper_sessions/
  paper_sessions_index.csv
  paper_sessions_index.json
```

Shared run history index:

```text
outputs/runs/
  runs_index.csv
  runs_index.json
  runs_index.md
```

`report.json` is the canonical public artifact.
Its machine-facing result block lives at:

```text
report.json.machine_contract
```

Legacy read-compatible artifacts still exist for older consumers:

- `meta.json` -> canonical replacement: `metadata.json`
- `run_report.json` -> canonical replacement: `report.json`

## Machine Request Example

Short `run` request:

```bash
python main.py --json-request "{\"schema_version\":\"1.0\",\"request_id\":\"req_demo_001\",\"command\":\"run\",\"params\":{\"ticker\":\"ETH-USD\",\"start\":\"2023-01-01\",\"end\":\"2023-12-31\",\"interval\":\"1d\"}}"
```

With lifecycle signalling:

```bash
python main.py --json-request "{\"schema_version\":\"1.0\",\"request_id\":\"req_demo_002\",\"command\":\"sweep\",\"params\":{\"config_path\":\"configs/experiments/eth_2023_grid.yaml\",\"out_dir\":\"outputs/stepbit\"}}" --signal-file logs/quantlab-signals.jsonl
```

## Recent Stabilization Highlights

- PR #63 added the canonical `report.json.machine_contract` for plain `run`
- PR #60 aligned plain `run` with canonical artifacts and automatic `runs_index` refresh
- PR #58 added CLI preflight checks and smoke validation for the machine-facing sweep path
- PR #55 stabilized the sweep contract for external-consumer oriented consumption

## Repo Signals

The repository already exposes a professional baseline for continued integration work:

- Apache-2.0 licensed
- GitHub Actions CI under `.github/workflows`
- source under `src/quantlab`
- public docs in `docs/`
- internal architecture memory in `.agents/`
- automated test coverage in `test/`

## Design Principles

- research-first before productization
- modular boundaries over monolithic growth
- reproducibility over ad hoc experimentation
- explicit contracts over implicit behavior
- extensibility without surrendering QuantLab Core authority

## Current Execution Boundary

Real broker work is still gated behind Stage D.0.

The current local safety boundary is documented in [docs/broker-safety-boundary.md](./docs/broker-safety-boundary.md) and defines the broker-agnostic execution contract that future adapters must follow.

The first dry-run backend slice now exists behind that boundary as a `KrakenBrokerAdapter`, still without real broker connectivity.

QuantLab can now also materialize a local Kraken dry-run review artifact with:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-dry-run-outdir outputs/broker_dry_runs/demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo --broker-max-notional 1000 --broker-allowed-symbols ETH/USD,BTC/USD
```

And it can run a read-only public preflight probe with:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-preflight-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD
```

And it can run a read-only Hyperliquid venue preflight probe with execution-context resolution:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-preflight-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_demo --broker-symbol ETH --execution-transport-preference websocket
```

And it can run a read-only Hyperliquid account/signer readiness probe:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-account-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_account_demo --execution-account-id 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

And it can build a local Hyperliquid action plus signature envelope for review:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-signed-action-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo --broker-symbol ETH --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --execution-account-id 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 --execution-nonce 1700000000000
```

And if you provide a signing key, the same artifact can carry a real local Hyperliquid signature without submitting anything:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-signed-action-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo --broker-symbol ETH --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --execution-account-id 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 --execution-signer-id 0xSIGNER_ADDRESS --hyperliquid-private-key-env HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY
```

And it can run a read-only authenticated preflight probe with Kraken credentials available in `KRAKEN_API_KEY` and `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-auth-preflight-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/auth_demo
```

And it can check whether your local secrets are sufficient before attempting the first supervised broker evidence pass:

```bash
python main.py --broker-evidence-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_evidence_demo
```

This writes:

```text
outputs/broker_evidence_demo/broker_evidence_readiness.json
```

If credentials are still missing, QuantLab fails with explicit blocking reasons without printing secret values.

And it can run a read-only account readiness probe for a specific broker intent:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-account-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/account_demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo
```

And it can run a validate-only Kraken order probe for a specific broker intent:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-order-validate-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/validate_demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo
```

And it can now persist canonical broker order-validation sessions under:

```text
outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/
```

And it can now persist a local approval decision for a reviewed validation session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-approve outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id> --broker-approval-reviewer marce --broker-approval-note "Approved after validate-only review"
```

And it can materialize a pre-submit bundle only from an approved validation session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-bundle outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

And it can materialize a supervised submit gate only from a session that already has a pre-submit bundle:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-submit-gate outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id> --broker-submit-reviewer marce --broker-submit-confirm --broker-submit-note "Ready for supervised submit review"
```

And it can materialize a supervised submit stub that shows the final payload it would submit:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-submit-stub outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

And it can perform a first tightly gated real Kraken submit from a session that already has a supervised submit gate:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-submit-real outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id> --broker-submit-reviewer marce --broker-submit-confirm --broker-submit-live --broker-submit-note "First supervised live submit"
```

This writes:

```text
outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/broker_submit_response.json
```

The response artifact captures the final submit payload, auth preflight context, remote submit status, broker response, and any returned `txid` values.

And it can reconcile an existing submit response against Kraken order state using the stable session-derived `userref`:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-reconcile outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

And it can refresh normalized post-submit order state for a submitted session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-status outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

This writes:

```text
outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/broker_order_status.json
```

And it can now summarize broker submission health:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-health outputs/broker_order_validations
```

And emit a deterministic broker submission alert snapshot:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-alerts outputs/broker_order_validations
```

And it can now persist canonical broker dry-run sessions under:

```text
outputs/broker_dry_runs/<session_id>/
```
