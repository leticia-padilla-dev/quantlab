# QuantLab CLI Guide

QuantLab is a CLI-first research system.
`main.py` is the public entrypoint and routes requests into the specialized CLI modules under `src/quantlab/cli/`.

This guide documents the current repository behavior, grouped by command family.

## 1. Health And Integration

### `--help`

```bash
python main.py --help
```

Prints the available flags and exits.

### `--version`

```bash
python main.py --version
```

Prints the current QuantLab version string.

### `--check`

```bash
python main.py --check
```

Prints a deterministic JSON health summary for runtime validation.

### `--json-request`

Machine-facing request entrypoint for:

- `run`
- `sweep`
- `forward`
- `portfolio`

Example:

```bash
python main.py --json-request "{\"schema_version\":\"1.0\",\"request_id\":\"req_demo_001\",\"command\":\"run\",\"params\":{\"ticker\":\"ETH-USD\",\"start\":\"2023-01-01\",\"end\":\"2023-12-31\"}}"
```

Optional lifecycle signalling:

```bash
python main.py --json-request "{\"schema_version\":\"1.0\",\"request_id\":\"req_demo_002\",\"command\":\"sweep\",\"params\":{\"config_path\":\"configs/experiments/eth_2023_grid.yaml\"}}" --signal-file logs/quantlab-signals.jsonl
```

## 2. Run Execution

Plain run:

```bash
python main.py --ticker ETH-USD --start 2022-01-01 --end 2023-12-31 --report
```

Successful plain runs write canonical artifacts under:

```text
outputs/runs/<run_id>/
```

Canonical files:

- `metadata.json`
- `config.json`
- `metrics.json`
- `report.json`

### `--paper`

Paper-backed run:

```bash
python main.py --ticker ETH-USD --start 2022-01-01 --end 2023-12-31 --paper --report
```

Paper execution is currently still entered through the `run` command surface, but it writes a dedicated paper-session artifact set under:

```text
outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>/
  session_metadata.json
  session_status.json
  config.json
  metrics.json
  report.json
  trades.csv
  run_report.md
```

Important contract note:

- externally, a JSON request still uses `command: "run"`
- lifecycle signals still emit `mode = "run"` for compatibility
- internally, the result is a paper session and `report.json.machine_contract.contract_type` is `quantlab.paper.result`

For the formal artifact contract, see [run-artifact-contract.md](./run-artifact-contract.md).

## 3. Run Registry And Inspection

### `--runs-list`

List runs under a root:

```bash
python main.py --runs-list outputs/runs
```

### `--runs-show`

Show one run:

```bash
python main.py --runs-show outputs/runs/20260324_005008_run_a468850
```

### `--runs-best`

Rank runs by a metric:

```bash
python main.py --runs-best outputs/runs --metric sharpe_simple
```

Shared index artifacts are refreshed automatically after successful:

- `run`
- `sweep`
- `forward`

Paper sessions do not currently refresh `outputs/runs/runs_index.*`.

Index files:

- `outputs/runs/runs_index.csv`
- `outputs/runs/runs_index.json`
- `outputs/runs/runs_index.md`

## 4. Paper Session Inspection

### `--paper-sessions-list`

List paper sessions under a root:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-list outputs/paper_sessions
```

### `--paper-sessions-show`

Show one paper session:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-show outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>
```

### `--paper-sessions-health`

Summarize paper-session health:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-health outputs/paper_sessions
```

The health summary is operator-facing and currently includes:

- total sessions
- count by status
- latest session id / activity time
- latest non-success session if present

### `--paper-sessions-alerts`

Emit a deterministic alert snapshot for paper sessions:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-alerts outputs/paper_sessions --paper-stale-minutes 60
```

Optional operational horizon window (recommended default: 7 days AND 20 sessions):

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-alerts outputs/paper_sessions \
  --paper-stale-minutes 60 \
  --paper-alert-window-days 7 \
  --paper-alert-window-sessions 20
```

The alert snapshot is machine-readable JSON and surfaces two layers:

- historical (computed over all sessions under `outputs/paper_sessions/`)
- current_window (computed over a horizon-filtered subset of sessions)

The snapshot currently makes these situations explicit:

- latest success visibility
- failed sessions
- aborted sessions
- running sessions that have become stale relative to the chosen threshold

Interpretation rule:

- `alert_status` / `alerts[]` is the historical posture and must remain visible
- `current_window_alert_status` / `current_window_alerts[]` is the operator's current operational read
- current_window may be green while historical remains critical

For the recommended operating loop and response guidance, see [paper-session-runbook.md](./paper-session-runbook.md).

For the governing policy (non-negotiables and the meaning of "current window"), see:

- [paper-failure-retention-and-alert-horizon-policy.md](./ops/paper-failure-retention-and-alert-horizon-policy.md)

For the current supervised broker happy path and failure path, see [supervised-broker-runbook.md](./supervised-broker-runbook.md).

### `--paper-sessions-index`

Refresh the shared paper-session index:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-index outputs/paper_sessions
```

This writes:

- `outputs/paper_sessions/paper_sessions_index.csv`
- `outputs/paper_sessions/paper_sessions_index.json`

The index is intentionally separate from `outputs/runs/runs_index.*` and is meant for repeated paper-session operations.

### `--paper-sessions-promotion`

Emit a broker-promotion report for paper sessions:

```bash
python main.py --paper-sessions-promotion outputs/paper_sessions
```

The promotion report highlights:

- paper sessions that are ready to move toward the broker boundary
- paper sessions that are still blocked and why
- the latest ready and blocked sessions for operator review

This command is meant to help bridge paper work into the supervised broker boundary without changing execution authority.

## 5. Broker Dry-Run

## 5.5. Broker Evidence Readiness

### `--broker-evidence-readiness-outdir`

Write a deterministic readiness artifact before the first supervised broker evidence pass:

```bash
python main.py --broker-evidence-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_evidence
```

Optional corridor selection:

```bash
python main.py --broker-evidence-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_evidence --broker-evidence-corridor kraken
python main.py --broker-evidence-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_evidence --broker-evidence-corridor hyperliquid
```

This writes:

- `broker_evidence_readiness.json`

The artifact makes these things explicit without printing secret values:

- requested and resolved corridor
- whether the evidence pass is actually ready to run
- which expected secrets are present by source name only
- expected local roots for:
  - `outputs/paper_sessions/`
  - `outputs/broker_order_validations/`
  - `outputs/hyperliquid_submits/`
- whether the supervised broker runbook is present

If the requested corridor is not ready, QuantLab still writes the artifact but exits with explicit blocking reasons.

## 5.6. Pre-Trade Handoff Intake

### `--pretrade-handoff-validate`

Validate a bounded `calculadora_riego_trading` handoff artifact:

```bash
python main.py --pretrade-handoff-validate path/to/quantlab_handoff.json
```

Optional output directory:

```bash
python main.py \
  --pretrade-handoff-validate path/to/quantlab_handoff.json \
  --pretrade-handoff-validation-outdir outputs/pretrade_handoff/demo
```

This writes:

- `pretrade_handoff_validation.json`

The artifact is intentionally local and bounded. It validates:

- handoff contract type/version
- source trade-plan lineage metadata
- `symbol`
- `venue`
- `side`
- trade-plan contract consistency

If the handoff is incomplete, QuantLab still writes the validation artifact but exits with explicit rejection reasons.

This surface does not yet:

- create pretrade sessions
- bridge into draft `ExecutionIntent`
- approve or submit anything

## 6. Broker Dry-Run

### `--hyperliquid-preflight-outdir`

Persist a read-only Hyperliquid venue preflight artifact:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-preflight-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_demo --broker-symbol ETH --execution-transport-preference websocket
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_demo/broker_preflight.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- adapter name
- generated timestamp
- input and normalized symbol
- market type (`perp` or `spot`)
- public API reachability
- market support result against Hyperliquid `meta` or `spotMeta`
- resolved coin and asset identifiers where available
- mid-price snapshot from `allMids` where available
- resolved execution-context details:
  - execution account
  - signer identity
  - routing target
  - transport preference
  - nonce scope
  - optional user-role lookups when valid addresses are provided
- explicit errors when market or context checks fail

This surface is read-only and does not place or validate orders.

### `--hyperliquid-account-readiness-outdir`

Persist a read-only Hyperliquid account and signer readiness artifact:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-account-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_account_demo --execution-account-id 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_account_demo/hyperliquid_account_readiness.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- resolved execution account and signer context
- execution account role and signer role where available
- nonce-scope identity
- open-orders visibility over the execution account
- `frontendOpenOrders` visibility over the execution account
- readiness result plus explicit reasons when the signer/account setup is not yet suitable for supervised personal use

This surface is read-only and does not sign or submit actions.

### `--hyperliquid-signed-action-outdir`

Persist a local Hyperliquid action and signature-envelope artifact without submitting it:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-signed-action-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo --broker-symbol ETH --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --execution-account-id 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 --execution-nonce 1700000000000
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo/hyperliquid_signed_action.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- normalized broker intent
- local policy preflight
- Hyperliquid venue preflight snapshot
- Hyperliquid account/signer readiness snapshot
- resolved nonce and nonce source
- resolved `expiresAfter` and how it was interpreted
- a local order action payload using resolved Hyperliquid asset identifiers
- a signature envelope with signing payload hash and signer metadata
- optional real local signature data when a signing key is available

Signer backend options:

- `--hyperliquid-private-key <HEX_KEY>`
- `--hyperliquid-private-key-env <ENV_NAME>`

Current limitation:

- this command itself does not submit anything to Hyperliquid
- if no signing key is present, the artifact keeps `signature_state = pending_signer_backend`

Example with signer backend enabled through environment:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-signed-action-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo --broker-symbol ETH --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --execution-account-id 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 --execution-signer-id 0xSIGNER_ADDRESS --hyperliquid-private-key-env HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY
```

- on success, the artifact moves to `signature_state = signed`
- if the derived signer address does not match `execution-signer-id`, the artifact reports `signature_state = signer_identity_mismatch`

### `--hyperliquid-submit-signed-action`

Submit a previously signed Hyperliquid artifact through the first supervised remote-submit path:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-signed-action outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo/hyperliquid_signed_action.json --hyperliquid-submit-reviewer marce --hyperliquid-submit-confirm --hyperliquid-submit-note "first supervised submit"
```

Required flags:

- `--hyperliquid-submit-reviewer`
- `--hyperliquid-submit-confirm`

Optional:

- `--hyperliquid-submit-note`

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo/hyperliquid_submit_response.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- source signed-action path
- source signer identity and payload hash
- final submit payload sent to Hyperliquid
- explicit reviewer and optional note
- remote-submit state
- exchange response snapshot
- response type where present
- explicit errors when submission is rejected or the signed artifact is not ready

Important safety notes:

- this path only accepts `hyperliquid_signed_action.json`
- the source artifact must already be `signature_state = signed`
- this is a narrow supervised submit surface, not yet a full session/reconciliation framework
- no websocket execution or cancel flow exists yet

### `--hyperliquid-submit-session`

Submit a previously signed Hyperliquid artifact into a canonical local session:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-session outputs/broker_preflight/hyperliquid_signed_action_demo/hyperliquid_signed_action.json --hyperliquid-submit-reviewer marce --hyperliquid-submit-confirm --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-root outputs/hyperliquid_submits
```

Optional root override:

- `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-root <ROOT_DIR>`

This writes a canonical session under:

```text
outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id>/
  session_metadata.json
  session_status.json
  hyperliquid_signed_action.json
  hyperliquid_submit_response.json
```

It also refreshes:

- `outputs/hyperliquid_submits/hyperliquid_submits_index.csv`
- `outputs/hyperliquid_submits/hyperliquid_submits_index.json`

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-list`

List canonical Hyperliquid submit sessions:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-list outputs/hyperliquid_submits
```

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-show`

Show one canonical Hyperliquid submit session:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-show outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id>
```

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-index`

Refresh the shared Hyperliquid submit index:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-index outputs/hyperliquid_submits
```

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-status`

Refresh normalized post-submit order status for one canonical Hyperliquid submit session:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-status outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id>
```

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-reconcile`

Run the first Hyperliquid reconciliation step for one canonical submit session:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-reconcile outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id>
```

This writes:

- `hyperliquid_reconciliation.json`

The reconciliation step is conservative:

- it checks direct `orderStatus` first
- it falls back to `historicalOrders`, `openOrders`, `frontendOpenOrders`, and `userFills` matching by `oid` or `cloid`
- it leaves the session in `unknown` with explicit reasons when no safe match is found

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-fills`

Refresh a richer fill summary for one canonical Hyperliquid submit session:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-fills outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id>
```

This writes:

- `hyperliquid_fill_summary.json`

The fill summary keeps reconciliation separate from fill accounting and aggregates:

- matched fill count
- filled and remaining size
- average fill price
- total fee and builder fee
- total closed PnL when present

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-supervise`

Run bounded continuous supervision over one canonical Hyperliquid submit session:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-supervise outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id>
```

Useful modifiers:

- `--hyperliquid-supervision-polls`
- `--hyperliquid-supervision-interval-seconds`

This writes:

- `hyperliquid_supervision.json`
- refreshed `hyperliquid_order_status.json`
- refreshed `hyperliquid_reconciliation.json`
- refreshed `hyperliquid_fill_summary.json`

The supervision step is intentionally still pull-based:

- it does not open private Hyperliquid websockets yet
- it does carry websocket-aware monitoring metadata when the execution context prefers websocket transport
- it gives operators a bounded local monitoring pass without introducing daemon-style runtime complexity

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-cancel`

Submit a supervised cancel request for one canonical Hyperliquid submit session:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-cancel outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id> --hyperliquid-cancel-reviewer marce --hyperliquid-cancel-confirm
```

This writes:

- `hyperliquid_cancel_response.json`

The cancel step is intentionally narrow:

- it requires an existing signed-action artifact and submit-response artifact
- it signs a fresh cancel action with the current Hyperliquid signer backend
- it prefers `oid` and falls back to `cloid` when needed
- it records cancel acceptance separately from remote order-state confirmation
- it does not claim the order is canceled until later status/reconciliation confirms that state

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-health`

Summarize Hyperliquid submission health across canonical submit sessions:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-health outputs/hyperliquid_submits
```

This prints a compact operator summary with:

- total sessions
- submit-response coverage
- cancel-response coverage
- submitted session count
- sessions with known order state
- sessions with reconciliation artifacts
- sessions with an effective known order state after reconciliation
- latest submit id/state
- latest notable issue id/code/time

### `--hyperliquid-submit-sessions-alerts`

Emit a deterministic alert snapshot for notable Hyperliquid submit-session states:

```bash
python main.py --hyperliquid-submit-sessions-alerts outputs/hyperliquid_submits
```

Alert output stays local and read-only. It is meant to highlight states such as:

- submitted sessions missing a persistent `hyperliquid_order_status.json`
- submitted sessions whose remote order state is still unknown
- rejected or canceled remote order states
- submit attempts that failed or remain in a non-ready state

This writes:

- `outputs/hyperliquid_submits/<session_id>/hyperliquid_order_status.json`

The status surface currently:

- queries Hyperliquid `orderStatus` using session-derived `oid` or `cloid`
- persists the raw order-status snapshot
- normalizes local state into `open`, `filled`, `canceled`, `rejected`, or `unknown`
- updates `session_status.json` so session inspection reflects the latest known order state

Current limitation:

- no Hyperliquid reconciliation flow exists yet beyond the direct `orderStatus` query
- no websocket supervision or cancel path exists yet

### `--kraken-preflight-outdir`

Persist a read-only Kraken public preflight artifact:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-preflight-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/demo/broker_preflight.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- adapter name
- generated timestamp
- input and normalized symbol
- public API reachability
- server time snapshot
- pair support result against Kraken public asset-pair metadata
- matched pair identifiers where available
- explicit errors when support or reachability checks fail

This surface is read-only and does not use private Kraken authentication.

### `--kraken-auth-preflight-outdir`

Persist a read-only Kraken authenticated preflight artifact:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-auth-preflight-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/auth_demo
```

By default this reads credentials from:

- `KRAKEN_API_KEY`
- `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`

Optional overrides:

- `--kraken-api-key`
- `--kraken-api-secret`
- `--kraken-api-key-env`
- `--kraken-api-secret-env`

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/auth_demo/broker_auth_preflight.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- whether credentials were present
- whether private authentication succeeded
- key name where available
- permissions snapshot where available
- restrictions snapshot where available
- created/updated timestamps where available
- explicit auth or credential errors

This surface is read-only and does not place or cancel orders.

### `--kraken-account-readiness-outdir`

Persist a read-only Kraken account snapshot and intent readiness artifact:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-account-readiness-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/account_demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo
```

By default this reads credentials from:

- `KRAKEN_API_KEY`
- `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`

It reuses the existing broker intent flags:

- `--broker-symbol`
- `--broker-side`
- `--broker-quantity`
- `--broker-notional`
- `--broker-account-id`
- `--broker-max-notional`
- `--broker-allowed-symbols`
- `--broker-kill-switch`
- `--broker-allow-missing-account-id`

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/account_demo/broker_account_snapshot.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- public pair support and matched Kraken pair identifiers
- base / quote asset mapping for the chosen pair
- pair minimums such as `ordermin` and `costmin` where available
- authenticated preflight summary
- extended balance snapshot where authentication and permissions allow it
- local preflight result for the provided `ExecutionIntent`
- balance-aware readiness result for that intent
- explicit reasons such as:
  - `private_auth_not_ready`
  - `account_snapshot_unavailable`
  - `funding_asset_missing`
  - `insufficient_available_balance`
  - `below_pair_ordermin`
  - `below_pair_costmin`

This surface is read-only and does not place or cancel orders.

### `--kraken-order-validate-outdir`

Persist a validate-only Kraken order probe artifact:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-order-validate-outdir outputs/broker_preflight/validate_demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo
```

By default this reads credentials from:

- `KRAKEN_API_KEY`
- `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`

It reuses the existing broker intent flags:

- `--broker-symbol`
- `--broker-side`
- `--broker-quantity`
- `--broker-notional`
- `--broker-account-id`
- `--broker-max-notional`
- `--broker-allowed-symbols`
- `--broker-kill-switch`
- `--broker-allow-missing-account-id`

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_preflight/validate_demo/broker_order_validate.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- authenticated preflight summary
- local policy preflight result
- Kraken validate-only payload
- whether the remote validate call was attempted
- whether Kraken accepted the validate-only order probe
- explicit validation reasons from local or exchange-side rejection
- raw exchange response where available

Important note:

- this does not place an order
- but it still uses Kraken's order-validation path and therefore may require order-related API permissions

### `--kraken-order-validate-session`

Persist a canonical broker order-validation session:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-order-validate-session --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo
```

This writes a canonical session under:

```text
outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/
  broker_order_validate.json
  session_metadata.json
  session_status.json
```

And refreshes the shared registry:

- `outputs/broker_order_validations/broker_order_validations_index.csv`
- `outputs/broker_order_validations/broker_order_validations_index.json`

### `--broker-order-validations-list`

List broker order-validation sessions:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-list outputs/broker_order_validations
```

### `--broker-order-validations-show`

Show one broker order-validation session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-show outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

### `--broker-order-validations-index`

Refresh the shared broker order-validation registry explicitly:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-index outputs/broker_order_validations
```

### `--broker-order-validations-approve`

Persist a local approval decision for one broker order-validation session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-approve outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id> --broker-approval-reviewer marce --broker-approval-note "Approved after validate-only review"
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/approval.json`

The approval artifact currently includes:

- `status = approved`
- `reviewed_by`
- `reviewed_at`
- optional `note`
- validation context fields carried forward from the reviewed session

Important note:

- this is a local human approval gate only
- it does not place an order
- it does not imply broker submission has happened

### `--broker-order-validations-bundle`

Generate a pre-submit bundle from an approved broker order-validation session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-bundle outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/broker_pre_submit_bundle.json`

The bundle currently includes:

- source `session_metadata.json`
- source `session_status.json`
- source `broker_order_validate.json`
- source `approval.json`
- source session id
- generation timestamp
- `bundle_state = ready_for_supervised_submit`

Important note:

- this command fails if the source validation session is not approved
- it still does not place an order
- it is the final local handoff artifact before any future supervised submit path

### `--broker-order-validations-submit-gate`

Generate a supervised submit gate artifact from a session that already has a pre-submit bundle:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-submit-gate outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id> --broker-submit-reviewer marce --broker-submit-confirm --broker-submit-note "Ready for supervised submit review"
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/broker_submit_gate.json`

The submit gate currently includes:

- source session id
- generation timestamp
- `submit_state = ready_for_supervised_submit_gate`
- reviewer identity
- optional reviewer note
- embedded source `broker_pre_submit_bundle.json`

Important note:

- this command fails if the source session does not already have a pre-submit bundle
- `--broker-submit-confirm` is required
- it still does not place an order
- it is the final local supervised gate before any future submit implementation

### `--broker-order-validations-submit-stub`

Generate a supervised submit stub artifact from a session that already has a submit gate:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-submit-stub outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/broker_submit_attempt.json`

The submit stub currently includes:

- source session id
- generation timestamp
- `submit_mode = stub`
- `would_submit = true`
- final submit payload derived from the validated session
- embedded source `broker_submit_gate.json`

Important note:

- this command fails if the source session does not already have a submit gate
- it still does not place an order
- it is the first operational shape of a future supervised submit path, but still entirely local

### `--broker-order-validations-submit-real`

Perform a first tightly gated real Kraken submit from a session that already has a submit gate:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-submit-real outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id> --broker-submit-reviewer marce --broker-submit-confirm --broker-submit-live --broker-submit-note "First supervised live submit"
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/broker_submit_response.json`

The submit response currently includes:

- source session id
- generation timestamp
- authenticated preflight summary
- final submit payload with stable `userref`
- a pre-remote local artifact write before the real submit call path
- whether the remote submit call was attempted
- whether the order was submitted successfully
- returned `txid` values where available
- raw exchange response
- explicit errors
- local reviewer identity and optional note
- embedded source `broker_submit_gate.json`

Important notes:

- this command fails if the source session does not already have a submit gate
- this command fails if the source validation session was not previously accepted by Kraken validate-only
- both `--broker-submit-confirm` and `--broker-submit-live` are required
- this is the first path that can hit Kraken's real order endpoint
- it is intentionally narrow and currently meant for supervised market-order submission only
- the session will persist `broker_submit_response.json` even when the remote submit is rejected or auth is not ready

### `--broker-order-validations-reconcile`

Reconcile an existing broker submit response against Kraken order state:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-reconcile outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

This command:

- requires an existing `broker_submit_response.json`
- uses the stable session-derived `userref`
- checks Kraken order state through authenticated account-data endpoints
- updates the existing submit response artifact in place with reconciliation details

The reconciliation update currently includes:

- whether reconciliation was attempted
- whether any matching order was found
- matched sources such as `open` or `closed`
- matched `txid` values
- matched order statuses
- explicit reconciliation errors

Important notes:

- this command is meant for ambiguous or post-submit review states, not for ordinary preflight
- it does not place a new order
- it is the current safety path before any future auto-retry or broader live routing logic

### `--broker-order-validations-status`

Refresh normalized post-submit order status for a submitted broker validation session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-status outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_order_validations/<session_id>/broker_order_status.json`

The order-status artifact currently includes:

- query mode (`txid` or `userref_fallback`)
- whether status lookup was attempted
- whether status is known
- normalized local state
- matched `txid` values
- raw exchange statuses
- matched order payloads where available
- explicit errors

Normalized local state currently maps to:

- `open`
- `closed`
- `canceled`
- `expired`
- `unknown`

Important notes:

- this command requires an existing `broker_submit_response.json`
- it does not place a new order
- it is the first persistent post-submit status surface for supervised broker sessions

### `--broker-order-validations-health`

Summarize broker submission health across broker order-validation sessions:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-health outputs/broker_order_validations
```

This command currently summarizes:

- total broker validation sessions
- how many sessions reached local approval
- how many reached submit-gate
- how many have submit responses
- how many were actually submitted
- how many already have known persistent order status
- latest submit session and latest notable issue

This surface is operator-facing and read-only.

### `--broker-order-validations-alerts`

Emit a deterministic alert snapshot for notable broker submission states:

```bash
python main.py --broker-order-validations-alerts outputs/broker_order_validations
```

The alert snapshot currently highlights:

- submitted sessions with missing order-status artifacts
- submitted sessions whose order state is still unknown
- rejected or not-ready submit states
- expired or canceled remote order states when known

The output is machine-readable JSON intended for local operator review and future low-coupling automation.

### `--kraken-dry-run-outdir`

Persist a local Kraken dry-run audit artifact:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-dry-run-outdir outputs/broker_dry_runs/demo --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo --broker-max-notional 1000 --broker-allowed-symbols ETH/USD,BTC/USD
```

This writes:

- `outputs/broker_dry_runs/demo/broker_dry_run.json`

The artifact currently includes:

- adapter name
- generated timestamp
- normalized execution intent
- execution policy
- preflight allow/reject result
- translated Kraken-style payload if preflight passes

If preflight rejects the intent, the artifact is still written with explicit rejection reasons and `payload = null`.

### `--kraken-dry-run-session`

Persist a canonical Kraken dry-run session:

```bash
python main.py --kraken-dry-run-session --broker-symbol ETH-USD --broker-side buy --broker-quantity 0.25 --broker-notional 500 --broker-account-id acct_demo --broker-max-notional 1000 --broker-allowed-symbols ETH/USD,BTC/USD
```

This writes a canonical session under:

```text
outputs/broker_dry_runs/<session_id>/
  broker_dry_run.json
  session_metadata.json
  session_status.json
```

And refreshes the shared registry:

- `outputs/broker_dry_runs/broker_dry_runs_index.csv`
- `outputs/broker_dry_runs/broker_dry_runs_index.json`

### `--broker-dry-runs-list`

List broker dry-run sessions:

```bash
python main.py --broker-dry-runs-list outputs/broker_dry_runs
```

### `--broker-dry-runs-show`

Show one broker dry-run session:

```bash
python main.py --broker-dry-runs-show outputs/broker_dry_runs/<session_id>
```

### `--broker-dry-runs-index`

Refresh the shared broker dry-run registry explicitly:

```bash
python main.py --broker-dry-runs-index outputs/broker_dry_runs
```

## 6. Forward Evaluation

### `--forward-eval`

Launch a forward session from a prior candidate-producing run directory:

```bash
python main.py --forward-eval outputs/runs/<grid_or_walkforward_run_id> --forward-start 2024-01-01 --forward-end 2024-06-01 --forward-outdir outputs/forward_runs/fwd_demo
```

### `--resume-forward`

Resume a prior forward session:

```bash
python main.py --resume-forward outputs/forward_runs/<session_id>
```

Typical forward session artifacts:

```text
outputs/forward_runs/<session_id>/
  portfolio_state.json
  forward_trades.csv
  forward_equity_curve.csv
  forward_returns_series.csv
  report.json
  forward_report.json
  forward_report.md
```

## 7. Portfolio Workflows

### `--portfolio-report`

Aggregate forward sessions:

```bash
python main.py --portfolio-report outputs/forward_runs
```

Selection/weighting example:

```bash
python main.py --portfolio-report outputs/forward_runs --portfolio-mode custom_weight --portfolio-weights path/to/weights.json --portfolio-top-n 5 --portfolio-rank-metric total_return
```

### `--portfolio-compare`

Compare allocation modes on the same forward-session universe:

```bash
python main.py --portfolio-compare outputs/forward_runs
```

Portfolio report artifacts are written in the target root, for example:

```text
outputs/forward_runs/
  report.json
  portfolio_report.json
  portfolio_report.md
  portfolio_compare.json
  portfolio_compare.md
```

## 8. Sweep Workflows

Flag-driven sweep:

```bash
python main.py --sweep configs/experiments/eth_2023_grid.yaml --sweep_outdir outputs/external_demo
```

Machine-facing sweep:

```bash
python main.py --json-request "{\"schema_version\":\"1.0\",\"request_id\":\"req_sweep_001\",\"command\":\"sweep\",\"params\":{\"config_path\":\"configs/experiments/eth_2023_grid.yaml\",\"out_dir\":\"outputs/external_demo\"}}"
```

`report.json.machine_contract` is the canonical machine-facing result surface for automated sweep consumption.

## 9. Legacy Flags

These remain accepted for backward compatibility, but should not be expanded further in docs or integrations:

- `--list-runs` -> legacy alias of `--runs-list`
- `--best-from` -> legacy alias of `--runs-best`

Legacy read-compatible artifacts also remain in the codebase:

- `meta.json`
- `run_report.json`
- `forward_report.json`
- `portfolio_report.json`

The preferred public surface is the canonical contract documented in [run-artifact-contract.md](./run-artifact-contract.md).

## 9. Design Rules

- `main.py` and `src/quantlab/cli/` should remain orchestration-only
- domain and quantitative logic belong outside the entrypoint
- new public behavior must be documented with executable examples
- new machine-facing behavior should prefer canonical artifacts over legacy outputs
