# Run Artifact Contract

This document defines the public artifact contract for QuantLab run-producing workflows.

It is intended for:

- local CLI users
- machine-to-machine integrations
- external-consumer adapter work
- downstream tools that read run history from disk

## Contract Root

Canonical run artifacts live under:

```text
outputs/runs/<run_id>/
```

The shared run history index lives under:

```text
outputs/runs/
```

Paper-session artifacts live under:

```text
outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>/
```

## Canonical Run Directory

The canonical artifact set for a run directory is:

```text
outputs/runs/<run_id>/
  metadata.json
  config.json
  metrics.json
  report.json
```

Additional artifacts may also exist, for example:

```text
outputs/runs/<run_id>/
  run_report.md
  trades.csv
  artifacts/
  leaderboard.csv
  walkforward.csv
```

## Canonical Paper Session Directory

Paper-backed executions currently produce a dedicated session directory:

```text
outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>/
  session_metadata.json
  session_status.json
  config.json
  metrics.json
  report.json
  trades.csv
  run_report.md
  artifacts/
```

Paper sessions are operationally distinct from research runs and are not part of the shared run registry under `outputs/runs/`.

## Canonical Files

### `metadata.json`

Execution identity and context.

Typical fields:

- `run_id`
- `created_at`
- `mode`
- `status`
- `command`
- `config_path`
- `config_hash`
- `request_id`

### `config.json`

Resolved configuration used for the run.

Typical fields:

- `ticker`
- `start`
- `end`
- `interval`
- fee and slippage settings
- resolved strategy/runtime parameters

### `metrics.json`

Machine-readable summary metrics for ranking and comparison.

Typical fields:

- `status`
- `summary`
- `best_result`
- `leaderboard_size`

### `report.json`

Canonical public report artifact for downstream consumption.

Typical top-level sections:

- `schema_version`
- `artifact_type`
- `status`
- `header`
- `config_resolved`
- `results`
- `artifacts`
- `summary`

## Quantitative Provenance and Authority

`schema_version` continues to describe JSON structure. New run, sweep,
walk-forward, paper, and forward artifacts additionally publish a distinct
`quantitative_contract`, `artifact_identity`, and
`canonical_metric_payload` on their canonical metadata/metrics/report
surfaces (and inside `report.json.machine_contract` when present).

The quantitative contract version is `1.0` and identifies these policies:

- `oos_equity_stitching: continuous_compounding_v1`
- `forward_resume_accounting: exactly_once_v1`
- `fee_and_slippage: notional_adverse_price_v1`
- `annualization: interval_timestamp_validated_v1`

Each policy records `applied`, `not_applicable`, or, for annualization,
`unavailable` with a reason according to the artifact-type matrix.

`artifact_identity` combines the informational `run_id`, a normalized
relative artifact path, the full source Git commit, and a SHA-256 digest.
The digest is computed from canonical JSON containing the identity without
the digest, the quantitative contract, and the shared canonical metric
payload. Administrative timestamps, absolute filesystem paths, JSON
formatting, and key order do not affect it.

Authority is always derived by the shared resolver; an embedded
`authority_status` is not trusted. The states are:

- `current`: visible and eligible for ranking, normal comparison, forward
  selection, and promotion;
- `superseded`: visible but ineligible for all authority-bearing uses;
- `unknown_provenance`: visible but ineligible for all authority-bearing
  uses.

Legacy artifacts without recognized provenance remain readable and visible
as `unknown_provenance`.

An optional non-destructive registry named
`quantitative_authority_registry.json` may live beside artifact directories.
It contains exact compound identities explicitly marked `superseded`.
Malformed, duplicate, conflicting, or ambiguous registry content fails
closed. The resolver precedence is invalid registry, exact supersession,
embedded contract/integrity validation, then legacy/missing provenance.
Classification never rewrites the artifact directory.

## `report.json.machine_contract`

The machine-facing contract is published inside `report.json` at:

```text
report.json.machine_contract
```

This is the shared public result surface for machine-driven `run` and `sweep` flows.

Expected fields include:

- `schema_version`
- `contract_type`
- `command`
- `status`
- `request_id`
- `run_id`
- `mode`
- `summary`
- `artifacts`

For plain `run`, `contract_type` is:

```text
quantlab.run.result
```

For plain `run`, the top-level `report.json.summary` should mirror the same core KPI block exposed through `report.json.machine_contract.summary`. The machine-facing canonical source remains `machine_contract`.

For `sweep`, `contract_type` is:

```text
quantlab.sweep.result
```

For paper-backed execution entered through `command: "run"`, `contract_type` is:

```text
quantlab.paper.result
```

In that case:

- the external invocation surface still remains `command: "run"`
- the produced artifact root is `outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>/`
- the returned `run_id` is the paper session identifier

## Shared Run Index

QuantLab maintains a shared run-history index under:

```text
outputs/runs/
  runs_index.csv
  runs_index.json
  runs_index.md
```

These files are refreshed automatically after successful:

- `run`
- `sweep`
- `forward`

Paper sessions are excluded from this shared run index.

They are intended as the read-only shared registry for browsing and integration.

The index exposes `quantitative_contract_version`, `authority_status`,
`authority_reason`, and the four eligibility flags. All parseable artifacts
remain visible, while normal comparison and `--runs-best` consider only
`current` evidence.

## Learned-Model Experiment Artifacts

Learned-model research uses a separate proposed artifact root:

```text
outputs/model_runs/<model_run_id>/
```

This root is intentionally separate from:

- `outputs/runs/<run_id>/`
- `outputs/paper_sessions/<session_id>/`

The initial N.0 contract defines these required artifacts:

```text
outputs/model_runs/<model_run_id>/
  dataset_manifest.json
  feature_manifest.json
  model_config.json
  training_summary.json
```

These artifacts do not replace `report.json`.

For N.0:

- `training_summary.json` is the primary learned-model summary artifact
- future downstream strategy or backtest evaluation may produce normal QuantLab `report.json` artifacts
- learned-model outputs must not become paper or execution actions without downstream validation and promotion gates

For the detailed N.0 contract, see [learned-model-artifact-contract.md](./learned-model-artifact-contract.md).

## Paper Session Status Contract

`session_status.json` is the canonical lifecycle artifact for paper sessions.

Expected fields include:

- `session_id`
- `status`
- `started_at`
- `updated_at`
- `finished_at` when terminal
- `terminal`
- `status_reason`
- `duration_seconds` when timing can be computed
- `error_type` and `message` when non-success

Stable `status_reason` values currently include:

- `active`
- `completed`
- `exception`
- `operator_abort`

## Legacy Compatibility

QuantLab keeps legacy read compatibility for older consumers:

- `meta.json` remains readable as a legacy predecessor of `metadata.json`
- `run_report.json` remains readable as a legacy predecessor of `report.json`

New run-producing flows should treat these as legacy compatibility surfaces, not as the canonical write target.

## Health Surfaces

QuantLab exposes stable machine-facing health surfaces through the CLI.

### Version

```bash
python main.py --version
```

Returns a stable version string.

### Preflight

```bash
python main.py --check
```

Returns a deterministic JSON health summary for runtime validation.

Typical fields include:

- `status`
- `project_root`
- `main_path`
- `src_root`
- `interpreter`
- `venv_active`
- `quantlab_import`
- `python_version`
- `version`

### Machine Request Surface

```bash
python main.py --json-request '<payload>'
```

`--json-request` remains the primary smoke-validation and machine-to-machine invocation surface for integration work.

Optional lifecycle signalling:

```bash
python main.py --json-request '<payload>' --signal-file path/to/signals.jsonl
```

Signal compatibility note:

- when `command: "run"` is combined with paper execution, signals still use `mode = "run"` to preserve the external contract
- paper-specific identity should be inferred from the paper-session artifact root and from `report.json.machine_contract.contract_type`

## Stability Notes

- `report.json` is the canonical public artifact
- `report.json.machine_contract` is the canonical machine-facing result block
- for plain `run`, top-level `summary` mirrors `machine_contract.summary` for compatibility
- `runs_index.csv/json/md` is the canonical shared run registry
- paper sessions use a separate artifact root and do not currently participate in the shared run registry
- legacy artifacts remain readable but are not the preferred write target for new flows
