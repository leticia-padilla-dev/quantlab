# Session Log - QuantLab

## 2026-07-26 — Quantitative Artifact Provenance (Issue #873)
- **Session Focus**: Make mathematical provenance and integrity mandatory for artifact authority without rewriting historical evidence.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added the shared quantitative contract, canonical metric digest, compound identity, validator, authority resolver, and external supersession registry contract.
  - Propagated provenance to new run, sweep, walk-forward, paper, and forward reports.
  - Kept legacy evidence visible while excluding non-current evidence from ranking, normal comparison, forward selection, portfolio selection, robustness, and paper promotion.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `schema_version` remains structural; calculation-contract versioning is independent.
  - Authority is derived and fail-closed; persisted authority claims are not trusted.
  - Historical classification and regeneration remain later, non-destructive operational work.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Tests use only temporary synthetic fixtures; no real `outputs/` content was scanned, classified, or modified.

## 2026-04-14 — Desktop Target Architecture and Shared Contract Guardrails (Issue #350)
- **Session Focus**: Fix the target Desktop architecture and migration guardrails so later shell and renderer slices stop reopening stack, authority, and continuity debates.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added `docs/desktop-target-architecture.md` as the accepted ADR for the Desktop target state.
  - Updated `docs/roadmap.md` to point the Desktop/UI track at the accepted architecture and to mark `research_ui` as transitional continuity.
  - Reflected the same direction in `.agents/architecture.md` and `.agents/decision-log.md`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Native desktop workstation surfaces are the target state; `research_ui` remains transitional continuity only.
  - `desktop/shared/` is the single owned cross-process contract source for shell, preload, renderer, and smoke boundaries.
  - Desktop remains a workstation layer; engine artifacts and execution semantics stay authoritative.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Checked the slice against the existing roadmap, Desktop migration block, and prior desktop shared-contract work so the ADR reuses existing direction instead of creating a parallel source of truth.
  - Kept the slice documentation-only with no runtime or CI changes.

## 2026-04-14 — Authoritative Local Working-Copy Posture (Issue #368)
- **Session Focus**: Restore a repeatable local repo posture so new slices always start from an authoritative base.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Updated `.agents/workflow.md` to define the required local working-copy posture after merges.
  - Updated `docs/workflow-operativo-codex.md` with the same rules for the canonical checkout, `main`, and when to keep or close secondary worktrees.
  - Audited current local worktrees against `origin/main`, pruned six stale merged mirrors, and switched the primary checkout back to local `main` fast-forwarded to `origin/main`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The canonical local starting point is the primary worktree on `main`, aligned to `origin/main`.
  - Secondary worktrees stay alive only when they still carry active local work or an open issue/PR context.
  - Dirty active worktrees are preserved as explicit exceptions; clean stale mirrors should be removed.
  - The only remaining active exception is `codex/desktop-tab-state-hardening`, which still carries local desktop work.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Verified local branches and worktrees against `origin/main` using `git branch -vv`, `git worktree list`, and left-right commit counts.
  - Confirmed the final local posture as three worktrees only: canonical `main`, the live desktop exception, and the active Issue #368 slice.
  - Kept the slice limited to workflow docs and repository sanitation only.

## 2026-04-14 — Workflow Policy for External Collaborators (Issue #367)
- **Session Focus**: Turn the current Codex and collaboration expectations into an explicit workflow contract that both humans and execution agents can follow.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Updated `.agents/workflow.md` with a mandatory collaboration contract for external contributors and Codex-based agents.
  - Added explicit source-of-truth, no-direct-push, no-stale-branch, and high-control-surface rules.
  - Aligned `docs/workflow-operativo-codex.md` with the same collaboration contract and mandatory post-merge hygiene.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The canonical repository state is `origin/main`; stale or orphaned branches are not valid starting points for new work.
  - Contributors may propose architecture, but roadmap and ownership changes remain repository-owner decisions.
  - Post-merge cleanup is part of the workflow contract, not optional hygiene.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Verified the touched docs remain aligned in scope and terminology.
  - Kept the slice documentation-only with no runtime or CI behavior changes.

## 2026-04-10 — Snapshot Status Contract Alignment (Issue #361)
- **Session Focus**: Align the desktop snapshot-status renderer semantics with the shared `desktop/shared/models/snapshot.ts` contract.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Updated `desktop/renderer/modules/tab-renderers.js` so snapshot refresh labels now branch on `ok`, `degraded`, `error`, and `idle` instead of stale `ready` / `loading` values.
  - Kept healthy snapshots mapped to `Live`, degraded snapshots mapped to warning semantics, and explicit error snapshots mapped to negative/unavailable semantics.
  - Added a small `node:test` regression file to lock the snapshot label/tone mapping against the current shared contract.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The shared snapshot contract remains the source of truth; the renderer adapts to it rather than expanding the contract back to old status names.
  - `degraded` and `error` remain separate operator states so local fallback or partial data does not look identical to a hard runtime failure.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Validate with `npm run typecheck`, `node --check renderer/app.js`, `node --check renderer/modules/tab-renderers.js`, and `node --test tests/snapshot-status.test.mjs` from `desktop/`.
  - Keep desktop smoke coverage in place to ensure the slice does not regress the current shell path.

## 2026-04-10 — Real-Path Desktop Validation and Smoke Semantics (Issue #275)
- **Session Focus**: Restore an honest distinction between fallback desktop smoke and real-path desktop validation.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Updated `desktop/scripts/smoke.js` to parse an explicit `--mode` and pass the selected smoke mode into Electron.
  - Kept fallback smoke on the local-shell path by disabling server boot only in fallback mode.
  - Hardened `desktop/main.js` so real-path smoke only succeeds when `research_ui` becomes reachable instead of accepting local-runs fallback.
  - Updated GitHub Actions to run the explicit `smoke:real-path` path under the dedicated `desktop-real-path` job name.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `smoke:fallback` remains useful for shell/bootstrap coverage, but its semantics stay intentionally tolerant.
  - `smoke:real-path` now means real `research_ui` reachability; local runs no longer count as success for that mode.
  - CI naming now reflects the stronger guarantee instead of implying generic smoke coverage.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Validate locally with both `npm run smoke:fallback` and `npm run smoke:real-path` from `desktop/`.
  - Confirm workflow syntax and behavior with the desktop smoke commands before opening the PR.

## 2026-03-24 — Canonical Run Machine Contract (Issue #62)
- **Session Focus**: Reduce the remaining contract asymmetry between plain `run` and `sweep` inside canonical `report.json`.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Extended `src/quantlab/reporting/run_report.py` so successful plain `run` reports now expose `report.json.machine_contract`.
  - Kept top-level `summary` / `kpi_summary` behavior unchanged for backward compatibility.
  - Added contract-oriented tests covering the canonical `run.machine_contract` shape and CLI-produced run reports.
  - Updated `.agents` docs and the Stepbit I/O contract docs to reflect the new machine-facing `run` surface.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Plain `run` now publishes `contract_type = "quantlab.run.result"` inside the same canonical report artifact already used by `sweep`.
  - `sweep` keeps its richer `best_result` field, while plain `run` stays narrower and summary-focused.
  - Backward-compatible top-level KPI blocks remain in place so older consumers do not break.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Verified focused behavior with `pytest` on `test_run_report.py`, `test_cli_run.py`, `test_sweep_contract.py`, and `test_machine_sweep_smoke.py`.

## 2026-03-24 — Canonical Run Outputs and Automatic Runs Index Refresh
- **Session Focus**: Align plain `run` with the canonical run artifact model and keep the shared runs index synchronized automatically.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Updated `src/quantlab/cli/run.py` so successful `run` executions create `outputs/runs/<run_id>/`.
  - Added canonical `run` artifact persistence for `metadata.json`, `config.json`, `metrics.json`, and `report.json`.
  - Ensured successful `run` executions always return a non-null `run_id` and canonical artifact paths.
  - Updated `main.py` to refresh `runs_index.csv/json/md` automatically after successful `run`, `sweep`, and `forward` commands.
  - Extended report generation so canonical `run` directories render a valid `report.json` without relying on legacy output conventions.
  - Added contract-oriented tests for canonical `run` outputs and main-level index refresh behavior.
  - Updated CLI, artifact-contract, and Stepbit I/O docs to reflect the new behavior.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The primary storage contract for plain `run` is now the same canonical run directory model already used by the more mature flows.
  - Automatic runs-index refresh is centralized in `main.py` after successful run-producing commands instead of being duplicated across handlers.
  - The dedicated `machine_contract` block was deferred for plain `run` and handled in follow-up Issue #62 after the artifact layout stabilized.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Verified focused behavior with `pytest` on `test_cli_run.py`, `test_runs_index_refresh.py`, `test_machine_sweep_smoke.py`, and `test_run_report.py`.
  - Verified broader artifact/index/CLI compatibility with `pytest` on `test_stage_g_artifacts.py`, `test_artifact_consistency.py`, `test_json_request.py`, `test_cli_health.py`, `test_run_index.py`, and `test_cli_runs.py`.

## 2026-03-23 — Preflight Checks and Sweep Smoke Validation (Issue #57)
- **Session Focus**: Add lightweight CLI preflight checks and a reproducible validation path for the machine-facing `sweep` contract.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added `--version` to print the stable QuantLab version string.
  - Added `--check` to emit a deterministic JSON runtime health report.
  - Anchored `src/` into `sys.path` before CLI imports so preflight commands can run without depending on the caller's current working directory.
  - Deferred heavy runtime imports until after `--version` / `--check` so the health path can validate missing runtime dependencies instead of crashing before argument handling.
  - Added CLI regression tests for `--version` and `--check`.
  - Added a smoke test that drives `main.py --json-request` with `command: "sweep"` and validates the emitted session context against `report.json.machine_contract`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `--version` stays intentionally simple and prints the bare project version.
  - `--check` prints a JSON object to stdout and exits with code `0` on success or `2` on invalid runtime state.
  - The existing machine-facing `--json-request` route remains the single smoke-validation surface for `sweep`; no new execution interface was added.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - Full `pytest` execution still depends on installing the repo's `dev` extras in the local venv.
  - Focused validation now has dedicated tests for CLI health and machine-facing `sweep` smoke coverage.

## 2026-03-23 — Stable Sweep Contract and Canonical Run Artifacts (Issue #53)
- **Session Focus**: Define and implement a stable machine-facing `sweep` output contract for Stepbit while normalizing run artifacts.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added canonical run artifact handling around `metadata.json`, `config.json`, `metrics.json`, and `report.json`.
  - Updated the sweep path to validate `params.config_path`, return stable context, and require canonical `report.json` after execution.
  - Extended `report.json` with a `machine_contract` block for `sweep` consumption.
  - Switched new sweep-generated runs away from writing `meta.json` and `run_report.json`; kept legacy read compatibility in reporting/index/forward-loading code.
  - Fixed the backtest initial-entry bug where the first bar could skip trade counting and costs when `positions[0] == 1`.
  - Fixed `--report` with `--trades_csv` so validation and report generation use the same path.
  - Added regression and contract-oriented tests for the new sweep/reporting behavior.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `report.json` remains the canonical machine-readable artifact; the stable `sweep` contract lives inside `report.json.machine_contract`.
  - Legacy artifact names remain read-compatible only.
  - `run_report.md` remains the human-readable Markdown artifact name for run directories.
- **Validation Notes**:
  - `pytest` is not installed in the local venv, so full test execution could not be completed in-session.
  - Verified syntax with `python -m compileall src test main.py`.
  - Verified the new sweep contract path with a focused smoke test that generated and read a canonical `report.json`.

## 2026-03-23 — Research Dashboard UI Polish
- **Session Focus**: Upgrade the research dashboard from MVP registry table to a richer, read-only analysis surface.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Redesigned `research_ui/index.html` into a stronger research-terminal style layout.
  - Rebuilt `research_ui/app.js` to add richer registry summary state, mode pills, toasts, and run detail loading from canonical artifacts.
  - Reworked `research_ui/styles.css` for a more intentional visual system with improved responsive behavior.
- **Key Decisions**: Kept the UI strictly read-only and artifact-driven. Used `runs_index.json` for registry state and loaded per-run `run_report.json` / `report.json` only for detail inspection.
- **Next Steps**: Verify the dashboard in a local browser session and decide whether Comparison should remain disabled or become the next UI slice.

## 2026-03-22 — Research Dashboard MVP (Phase 1)
- **Session Focus**: Create a tangible, read-only UI layer for browsing research runs.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Scaffolded `research_ui/` with Vanilla JS/CSS (zero-dependency SPA).
  - Implemented `research_ui/server.py` for local dev-preview with 302 redirect for asset routing.
  - Built the Run Index table with real-time sorting and filtering.
  - Fixed unstyled UI issue caused by root-path asset resolution.
  - Handled port conflicts in the dev server.
- **Key Decisions**: Kept the UI strictly read-only and decouped from the core. Used a 302 redirect in the dev server to normalize browser context for relative asset paths.
- **Next Steps**: Phase 2 implementation for Run Detail and Comparison views.

## 2026-03-21 — Event Signalling & Session Hooks (Issue #25)
- **Session Focus**: Implement file-based session lifecycle notifications for Stepbit.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Implemented `SignalEmitter` in `main.py` with append-only JSON Lines support.
  - Added `--signal-file` CLI argument.
  - Updated CLI handlers (`run`, `sweep`, `forward`, `portfolio`, `report`, `runs`) to return execution context.
  - Implemented `SESSION_STARTED`, `SESSION_COMPLETED`, and `SESSION_FAILED` event emission in `main.py`.
  - Synchronized `.agents/stepbit-io-v1.md` and `docs/stepbit-io-v1.md`.
  - Fixed a literal `%` bug in `argparse` help strings causing `ValueError`.
- **Key Decisions**: Used append-only JSON Lines for best-effort signalling; deferred webhook delivery. Ensured handler changes were minimal for context propagation.
- **Next Steps**: Hand over for Stepbit integration testing.

## 2026-03-21 — QuantLab Runbook for Stepbit (Issue #26)
- **Session Focus**: Create operational documentation for Stepbit integration and sync I/O contract status.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Created `.agents/stepbit-runbook.md` organized by Prepare, Invoke, Interpret, and Recover.
  - Synchronized `.agents/stepbit-io-v1.md` and `docs/stepbit-io-v1.md`.
  - Updated I/O status labels for `schema_version` validation, `request_id` propagation, and exit codes 3/4 [done].
  - Documented missing Issue #24 features (`--check`, `--version`, path anchoring) as explicit operational gaps.
- **Key Decisions**: Documented current repository reality only, deferring restoration of missing runtime features to a dedicated slot.
- **Next Steps**: Hand over for review and eventual restoration of Issue #24 features if required.

## 2026-03-20 — Stepbit Error Policy (Issue #23)
- **Session Focus**: Harden the CLI for predictable headless Stepbit-driven execution.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Implemented strict `schema_version` and `command` validation in `main.py` (exit 2 for invalid input).
  - Propagated `request_id` to `args._request_id` for traceability.
  - Implemented explicit command dispatch for JSON requests, ensuring predictable routing regardless of flag fallthrough.
  - Added 8 unit tests in `test/test_json_request.py`.
- **Key Decisions**: Forced `command` field in JSON requests as hard required. Treated missing command as invalid input (exit 2).
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Issue #22 for consistent `report.json` and artifact production.

## 2026-03-20 — Stepbit I/O Contract (Issue #20)
- **Session Focus**: Verify and publish the Stepbit I/O contract document.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Analyzed gap between `.agents/stepbit-io-v1.md` design and current CLI/artifact reality.
  - Created `docs/stepbit-io-v1.md` with accurate `[done]`/`[planned]` labels, corrected artifact path (`run_report.json`), and linked gaps to Issues #21–#23.
  - Synced `.agents/stepbit-io-v1.md` to match `docs/stepbit-io-v1.md` exactly — both files now share the same corrected contract.
- **Key Decisions**: No code changes. Response envelope, fingerprint, and schema validation deferred to #21–#23.
- **Next Steps**: Hand over to user for review and branch merge.

## 2026-03-20 — Runs CLI Interface (Issue #12)
- **Session Focus**: Implement the `runs.py` command surface for run navigation.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Implemented `--runs-list`, `--runs-show`, `--runs-best` in `src/quantlab/cli/runs.py`.
  - Wired `handle_runs_commands` into `main.py` before the report handler.
  - Migrated `--list-runs` and `--best-from` out of `report.py`; kept deprecated aliases for backward compat.
  - Added 13 tests in `test/test_cli_runs.py`; full test suite passes.
- **Key Decisions**: Kept `--compare` in `report.py` — it writes artifacts and is a reporting operation, not run navigation. Migrating it is deferred.
- **Next Steps**: Hand over to user for review and branch merge.

## 2026-03-20 — Post-CLI Roadmap Definition (Issue #14)
- **Session Focus**: Define the next development milestones for QuantLab after the CLI refactor.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Analyzed repository state and maturity.
  - Formalized Stage N (Run Lifecycle Management) and Stage O (Stepbit Automation Readiness) in `current-state.md`.
- **Key Decisions**: Prioritized internal run management (`quantlab runs`) over immediate Stepbit integration to ensure the research lab's utility.
- **Next Steps**: Begin Stage N implementation (Issue #12).

## 2026-03-20 — Stage M.4 Gap Closure
- **Session Focus**: Enrich portfolio mode comparison artifacts (JSON/Markdown) to meet specification.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Updated `portfolio_mode_compare.py` to store full mode blocks (candidates, allocation, summary) in the JSON payload.
  - Added "Weight Comparison" table to `portfolio_compare.md`.
  - Updated `test/test_portfolio_mode_compare.py` and verified all portfolio tests pass.
- **Key Decisions**: Decided to include full candidate metadata in the comparison JSON to ensure each mode's aggregation is fully traceable.
- **Next Steps**: Hand over to user for review and branch merge.

## 2026-03-10 — Run System Foundations
- **Session Focus**: Implement minimal infrastructure for structured, reproducible run storage.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Created `quantlab.runs` module.
  - Implemented `serializers.py`, `run_id.py`, `run_store.py`, and `registry.py`.
  - Added comprehensive unit tests in `test/test_runs_foundation.py`.
  - Verified all tests pass.
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Centralized run identity and storage to ensure strict adherence to `artifact-contracts.md`.
  - Adopted deterministic JSON serialization and run IDs.
- **Next Steps**: Integrate the new Run Store into the experiment `runner.py` and migrate existing "legacy" outputs.

## 2026-03-07 — Stage M.3 Closed
- **Session Focus**: Final verification and closure of Stage M.3.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Verified that `test/test_portfolio_selection.py` passes.
  - Verified that `test/test_portfolio_report.py` passes.
  - Verified that `test/test_portfolio_allocation.py` passes.
  - Verified that `test/test_portfolio_hygiene.py` passes.
  - Verified that normal CLI portfolio reporting still works with `--portfolio-report .\outputs\forward_runs`.
  - Verified that empty-selection behavior now fails loudly with a clear `ValueError`.
- **Key Decisions**: Stage M.3 is considered closed, with explicit fail-loud behavior when no sessions remain after selection rules are applied.
- **Next Steps**: Begin Stage M.4 for portfolio mode comparison across `raw_capital`, `equal_weight`, and `custom_weight`.

## 2026-03-07 — Workflow Alignment
- **Session Focus**: Align `.agents` documentation with the actual project state.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Updated `current-state.md` with the completed stages currently tracked in the workflow system: I, J, K, L, L.1, L.2, L.2.a, L.2.b, M, M.1, and M.2.
  - Rewrote `stage-m3-selection-rules.md` to describe M.3 candidate selection and inclusion filters, instead of M.2 allocation controls.
  - Fixed `read-and-plan.md` by correcting `session_log.md` → `session-log.md`, adding the `implementation-rules.md` read step, and making the approval gate explicit.
  - Updated `project-brief.md` to include the `portfolio/` component, the full staged roadmap table, and the source-of-truth file list.
- **Key Decisions**: M.3 is defined as the stage for session selection and inclusion control, including top-N filtering, metric-based filters, ticker/strategy filters, and latest-per-source-run selection. These rules are applied **before** M.2 allocation weighting.
- **Next Steps**: Begin Stage M.3 using the `/read-and-plan` workflow.

## 2026-03-07 — Documentation Structure Initialization
- **Session Focus**: Documentation and workflow structure cleanup.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Initialized the `.agents` structure with starter templates.
  - Standardized file naming using lowercase-hyphen format.
  - Verified preservation of existing files.
- **Key Decisions**: `.agents` will serve as the lightweight project memory and workflow coordination layer for QuantLab.
- **Next Steps**: Continue aligning documentation and workflow files with the real project structure and stage progression.

## 2026-04-07 — Desktop Workstation UI Direction
- **Session Focus**: Define a workstation-oriented desktop UI issue block and implement the first high-impact slice in QuantLab Desktop.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added a proposed desktop UI workstation issue block under `.agents/tasks/`.
  - Created issue packets #201 to #205 covering shell hierarchy, runs home, run detail evidence rail, compare/candidates density, and assistant demotion.
  - Implemented default desktop startup behavior so the shell now prefers `Runs` when indexed run data is available and falls back to `System` otherwise.
  - Redesigned the native `Runs` tab into a denser workbench with summary cards, central table, and an evidence/context rail.
  - Verified the desktop with `npm run smoke` in `desktop/`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The UI reference should guide layout maturity and hierarchy, not trading semantics or portfolio-monitoring language.
  - `Runs` is the correct primary desktop surface because it best expresses QuantLab's research, artifact, and decision identity.
  - The remaining workstation redesign should proceed as incremental slices instead of a full renderer rewrite.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement Issue #203 to harden `Run Detail` into a stronger evidence rail.
  - Implement Issue #204 to align `Compare` and `Candidates` with the new workstation density.

## 2026-04-07 — Run Detail Evidence Rail
- **Session Focus**: Implement Issue #203 so `Run Detail` matches the workstation direction established in `Runs`.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Reworked `Run Detail` into a two-column workstation layout with a primary evidence stack and a persistent right-side rail.
  - Moved result evidence, config provenance, launch review linkage, and sweep linkage into the primary evidence column.
  - Hardened the right-side rail around run decision context, artifact continuity, and workspace linkage.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `Run Detail` should prioritize evidence review and operational continuity over a flat sequence of panels.
  - The right rail should remain stable and summary-oriented while the main column carries the denser inspection blocks.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement Issue #204 to bring `Compare` and `Candidates` up to the same workstation density and hierarchy.

## 2026-04-07 — Compare and Candidates Workbench Density
- **Session Focus**: Implement Issue #204 so comparison and decision-queue surfaces match the workstation grammar already established in `Runs` and `Run Detail`.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Rebuilt `Compare` around a dense ranking matrix with a stable right-side decision rail.
  - Reworked `Candidates` into a queue-oriented workstation with persistent filters, baseline visibility, shortlist readiness, and recency-aware ordering.
  - Hardened candidate cards to expose decision-relevant metrics, continuity metadata, and actions directly in the queue.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `Compare` should optimize for operator ranking speed, so the center of gravity moved from loose cards to a sortable matrix.
  - `Candidates` should behave like explicit local decision memory, so baseline and shortlist state must remain visible even while filtering.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement Issue #205 to demote the assistant and command surface behind the workstation-first shell hierarchy.

## 2026-04-07 — Assistant and Command Surface Demotion
- **Session Focus**: Implement Issue #205 so the desktop reads workstation-first while retaining the assistant as support tooling.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Reordered the main shell layout so focused work surfaces and workflow blocks lead the page, with assistant support moved into a dedicated lateral column.
  - Moved the quick command entry into the support lane and reduced the visual weight of browser/assistant controls.
  - Changed assistant focus behavior so opening the assistant no longer clears the active work surface.
  - Trimmed sidebar suggested actions to a smaller workstation-oriented set.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The assistant remains always available, but it should not reset or replace the active investigation surface.
  - The command palette stays global, while the inline support command becomes secondary to tabs, runs, compare, and workflow.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Use the next slice to polish visual density and product-brand alignment now that the shell hierarchy is workstation-first.

## 2026-04-07 — Desktop Visual Polish and Renderer Cleanup
- **Session Focus**: Complete the next ordered tranche after the workstation issue block: visual polish first, then renderer cleanup.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Polished the desktop workstation palette, surface treatments, and brand mark in `desktop/renderer/index.html` and `desktop/renderer/styles.css` so the shell reads closer to a QuantLab research instrument than a generic dashboard.
  - Standardized dense workstation surfaces across run detail, runs, compare, candidates, system, workflow, and assistant support panels by removing leftover older panel treatments and fixing a stray CSS brace.
  - Extracted shell chrome copy, nav mapping, and command palette metadata into `desktop/renderer/modules/shell-chrome.js` so `desktop/renderer/app.js` is more focused on state, events, and rendering.
  - Validated `research_ui` reachability and reran desktop smoke until it passed cleanly.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Desktop branding stays local to the renderer for now; the immediate goal is workstation coherence, not a cross-repo asset package.
  - Static shell chrome and action definitions are now treated as renderer configuration, not inline app-state logic.
- **Next Steps**:
  - If the desktop continues to evolve, the next cleanup slice should target renderer module boundaries and shared surface primitives rather than more copy accretion in `app.js`.

## 2026-04-07 — Renderer Surface Primitives
- **Session Focus**: Execute the next renderer cleanup slice by extracting repeated HTML primitives used across dense workstation tabs.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added `desktop/renderer/modules/view-primitives.js` for reusable action buttons, action rows, empty states, and metric-list rendering.
  - Repointed key workstation surfaces in `desktop/renderer/modules/tab-renderers.js` to the shared primitives, especially runs, run detail, artifacts, candidates, sweep handoff, and system.
  - Removed dead `renderSummaryCard` / `compareMetric` pass-through wrappers from `desktop/renderer/app.js`.
  - Revalidated the desktop with `npm run smoke`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Shared surface helpers belong beside the renderer modules, not back in `app.js`.
  - The immediate goal is reducing markup duplication while preserving the existing `data-*` event contract used by the shell bindings.
- **Next Steps**:
  - The next renderer slice should target event-binding consolidation for repeated `data-*` actions so `app.js` keeps shrinking without changing shell behavior.

## 2026-04-07 — Renderer Data-Action Binding Consolidation
- **Session Focus**: Execute the next hardening slice by consolidating repeated `data-*` event bindings in the desktop renderer.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added generic binding helpers in `desktop/renderer/app.js` for `data-*` click/change handlers plus shared external-URL and local-path actions.
  - Replaced repeated manual selector loops in workflow lists, tab content binding, and run context actions with the new helpers.
  - Preserved the existing `data-*` contract so `tab-renderers.js` and `view-primitives.js` continue to interoperate without markup changes.
  - Revalidated the desktop with `npm run smoke`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - This slice stays inside `app.js`; no event contract or tab payload shape was changed.
  - The correct cleanup axis is to centralize binding mechanics first, then consider reducing the number of action variants later.
- **Next Steps**:
  - The next renderer slice should target common tab-action maps so each `tab.kind` block carries less inline binding code.

## 2026-04-07 — Tab Action Map Cleanup
- **Session Focus**: Continue renderer hardening by making `bindTabContentEvents` more declarative while preserving the existing desktop behavior.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added batched action helpers in `desktop/renderer/app.js` for grouped `data-*`, external-link, and path bindings.
  - Rewrote the `tab.kind` branches in `bindTabContentEvents` to use grouped action specs instead of long runs of individual binding calls.
  - Kept the same `data-*` event contract used by `tab-renderers.js` and the workstation surfaces.
  - Revalidated the desktop with `npm run smoke`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The hardening path remains incremental: reduce binding boilerplate before attempting broader tab-dispatch abstraction.
  - No action names, tab ids, or renderer payload shapes were changed in this slice.
- **Next Steps**:
  - The next cleanup slice should extract per-tab binding maps or registries so `bindTabContentEvents` becomes a dispatcher rather than a large conditional block.

## 2026-04-07 — Issue #206 Topbar and Global Chrome Maturity
- **Session Focus**: Start the visual-maturity block by improving desktop topbar hierarchy and shell-level context without changing tab behavior.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Strengthened the shell topbar in `desktop/renderer/index.html` with clearer workstation framing, global-action copy, and visible runtime/server/surface chips.
  - Added topbar chrome styling in `desktop/renderer/styles.css` so the header reads as a deliberate workstation control band rather than a minimal shell row.
  - Extended `desktop/renderer/modules/shell-chrome.js` with topbar defaults and updated `desktop/renderer/app.js` to keep topbar runtime, server, and surface context synchronized with live state.
  - Revalidated the desktop with `npm run smoke`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - This issue stays strictly shell-level: no tab payloads, no backend contracts, and no changes to workstation content surfaces.
  - Topbar maturity is handled through visible context chips rather than adding decorative controls or generic dashboard chrome.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Move to Issue #207 and focus specifically on `Runs` table semantics, row scanning speed, and visual state clarity.

## 2026-04-07 — Issue #207 Runs Table Visual Semantics and Density Polish
- **Session Focus**: Improve the primary `Runs` surface so row scanning is faster and operational state is more legible without changing data contracts.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Reworked the `Runs` table in `desktop/renderer/modules/tab-renderers.js` so run identity, metadata, window, metrics, and state are grouped more clearly by row.
  - Added per-row state summaries for decision memory, launch continuity, and artifact readiness using lightweight dot signaling rather than extra prose.
  - Polished table density and scanability in `desktop/renderer/styles.css`, including primary-cell hierarchy, inline mode chips, compact actions, and clearer state rows.
  - Revalidated the desktop with `npm run smoke`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The slice stays inside existing run data and local continuity context; no new backend metrics or contracts were introduced.
  - State signaling is kept sober and workstation-oriented rather than chart-heavy or trading-dashboard styled.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Move to Issue #208 and strengthen the right rail so the selected-context panels reach the same maturity level as the `Runs` table.

## 2026-04-07 — Current-State Debt Cleanup
- **Session Focus**: Remove stale technical debt from `.agents/current-state.md` so the repo state remains trustworthy.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Verified that the previously referenced duplicate workflow file `strategy_research.md` no longer exists under `.agents/workflows/`.
  - Removed the stale known-issue entry from `.agents/current-state.md`.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `current-state.md` should only track active debt that still exists in the tree.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Keep future `.agents` debt items tied to verifiable repository state before carrying them forward.

## 2026-04-07 — Desktop Smoke CI and Positioning Alignment
- **Session Focus**: Close the next two follow-up blocks after the runtime hotfix: desktop smoke coverage in CI and minimal public positioning cleanup for the desktop shell.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Added a dedicated `desktop-smoke` GitHub Actions job that sets up Python and Node, installs desktop dependencies, and runs `npm run smoke` under `xvfb`.
  - Updated public desktop descriptions in `README.md` and `desktop/README.md` so the shell is described as workstation-first with assistant support, not chat-centered.
  - Updated `docs/quantlab-desktop-v1.md` so its top-level framing now reflects workstation-first hierarchy with a specialized assistant support lane.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Desktop validation is now treated as a first-class CI concern rather than a local-only manual check.
  - The positioning cleanup stays narrow: align the shell hierarchy language without reopening broader product-brand or desktop roadmap debates.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Verify the new GitHub Actions desktop-smoke job on the next remote run and adjust only if the hosted runner needs extra Electron runtime packages.

## 2026-04-08 — Restore Desktop Boot Decoupling
- **Session Focus**: Resolve the semantic regression around `fix(desktop): decouple shell from research_ui boot` without overwriting the newer workstation renderer work.
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Restored IPC response envelopes in `desktop/main.js` and matching unwrap logic in `desktop/preload.js` for `request-json`, `request-text`, and `post-json`.
  - Reinstated smoke semantics in `desktop/scripts/smoke.js` and `desktop/main.js` so the desktop passes when the shell boots from a local runs index even if `research_ui` does not become reachable.
  - Added a smoke-only environment flag so desktop smoke now exercises the local-fallback boot path deterministically instead of silently passing through a live `research_ui` server.
  - Ported local fallback loading back into `desktop/renderer/app.js` for runs registry refresh, run detail artifact reads, and optional text/log reads while keeping the current workstation layout intact.
  - Updated runtime messaging so the desktop explicitly reports when it is running from local artifacts rather than a live `research_ui` server.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - The port is surgical: preserve the current renderer chrome, tabs, and hardening work, and only reintroduce the pieces required for true boot decoupling.
  - Local fallback remains shell-first: native surfaces stay usable without `research_ui`, while browser-backed surfaces still wait for a live server.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Revalidate `npm run smoke` and then continue the visual maturity block starting with Issue #208.
- 2026-04-08: Completed issue #208 right-rail evidence panel maturity. Runs now prioritizes selected/baseline/latest context in a sticky evidence rail, and Run Detail exposes stronger artifact posture, continuity, and local file context without adding new runtime endpoints.
- 2026-04-08: Completed issue #209 status language and state signaling refinement. Desktop surfaces now reuse the same tone vocabulary for ready, pending or review, and degraded states across runs, run detail, system, paper ops, launch review, and topbar chrome.
- 2026-04-08: Completed issue #210 typography, spacing, and panel polish pass. The desktop chrome now uses a tighter mono label system, more consistent panel padding and hierarchy, and updated topbar defaults so the workstation reads as one cohesive product surface without changing runtime behavior.
- 2026-04-08: Updated `.agents/workflow.md` so chat ownership is now a constant repo rule. The workflow file now defines stable Engine versus Desktop/UI ownership, cross-boundary stop rules, branch and dirty-tree preflight checks, and a requirement to record the validation actually run.
- 2026-04-08: Started issue #214 renderer tab binding registry hardening. This slice is limited to `desktop/renderer/app.js` plus `.agents` continuity, and replaces the long `bindTabContentEvents` conditional chain with a local handler registry without changing renderer behavior.
- 2026-04-08: Completed issue #214 renderer tab binding registry hardening. `bindTabContentEvents` now dispatches through a local `TAB_CONTENT_EVENT_BINDERS` registry in `desktop/renderer/app.js`, and `npm run smoke` still passes via local runs fallback.
- 2026-04-10: Started issue #342 to restore primary workbench ownership after the desktop kept reserving too much width for empty or low-value side panes. This slice introduces a workbench-priority layout mode in the renderer so support and internal rails collapse earlier on common laptop widths instead of compressing the active surface.
- 2026-04-10: Completed issue #342 primary workbench ownership. The renderer now marks workbench-heavy surfaces explicitly and collapses the outer support lane plus internal two-column workbench grids earlier, so `Runs`, `Compare`, `Candidates`, `Run Detail`, and `Paper Ops` stop holding two side rails at the same laptop-width breakpoint. Validation passed with `node --check desktop/renderer/app.js`, `npm run smoke:fallback`, and `npm run smoke:real-path`.
- 2026-04-10: Started issue #346 to harden `desktop-smoke` result persistence after CI repeatedly failed with raw `ENOENT` on missing `result.json` in a planning-only PR. The slice is limited to `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/scripts/smoke.js`, and `.agents` continuity so smoke emits structured failures instead of crashing when Electron exits too early.
- 2026-04-10: Added the desktop layout regression remediation block after reviewing the post-merge desktop state in real screenshots. Opened issues #342, #343, and #344 to target empty-pane collapse, stronger active-surface focus and context containment, and better runs-family density plus right-rail space budgeting without reopening core or `research_ui` scope.
- 2026-04-10: Added the Desktop architecture migration block after accepting the ADR direction for the new shell foundation. Opened issues #350, #354, #353, #355, #352, #359, #351, #357, #358, and #356 so the migration is tracked as real slices rather than dozens of micro-backlog items.
- 2026-04-10: Started the desktop shared contracts foundation slice on branch `codex/desktop-shared-workspace-contract`. The goal is to establish the first real shared Desktop contract layer before opening the larger `desktop-typescript-base` slice, limited to workspace, runtime/snapshot, and smoke boundaries.
- 2026-04-10: Completed the desktop shared contracts foundation slice. Added `desktop/shared` contracts for IPC channels, envelopes, workspace state, runtime state, snapshot status, and smoke results, and connected them back into `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/preload.js`, `desktop/renderer/app.js`, and `desktop/scripts/smoke.js` via narrow JSDoc typing only, without changing desktop behavior.
- 2026-04-10: Started issue #354 on branch `codex/desktop-typescript-base`. This slice is limited to the real TypeScript base for `desktop/`: `tsconfig.json`, `types/global.d.ts`, package wiring, and only the minimum edits required in `main.js`, `preload.js`, and `renderer/app.js` so typecheck passes without changing desktop behavior.
- 2026-04-10: Completed issue #354 TypeScript base real across Desktop. Added `desktop/tsconfig.json`, `desktop/types/global.d.ts`, and package wiring for `typecheck`, then applied only the minimum `@ts-check` and DOM/type narrowing changes in `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/preload.js`, and `desktop/renderer/app.js` so `npm run typecheck`, `node --check`, `npm run smoke:fallback`, and `npm run smoke:real-path` all pass without changing visible desktop behavior.
- 2026-04-14: Added issue #370 to update `docs/roadmap.md` with a clearer promotion path, lighter historical detail, and explicit transversal Desktop/UI positioning. This docs slice is intentionally restricted to the roadmap itself unless a direct contradiction forces one minimal supporting doc change.
- 2026-04-14: Added the repo governance and sanitation issue block after reviewing the actual local workspace and `.agents` authority documents. Opened issues #366, #367, and #368 to repair `current-state`, workflow ownership and post-merge hygiene, and the authoritative local working-copy posture without mixing runtime or product changes.
- 2026-04-10: Started issue #353 on branch `codex/issue-353-modularize-main-process`. This slice is limited to splitting `desktop/main.js` by responsibility after the TypeScript base landed, without touching renderer behavior, `research_ui`, or preload contracts.
- 2026-04-10: Completed issue #353 desktop main process modularization. Extracted `desktop/main/` modules for config, local stores, workspace state, research_ui lifecycle, Stepbit chat, smoke support, window creation, and IPC registration, and reduced `desktop/main.js` to lifecycle wiring and service composition. Validation passed with `npm run typecheck`, `node --check` for `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/main/*.js`, `desktop/preload.js`, and `desktop/renderer/app.js`, plus `npm run smoke:fallback` and `npm run smoke:real-path`.
- 2026-04-15: Started issue #382 after the legacy fallback renderer became visually unsafe to launch. The immediate problem was not the bootstrap anymore, but React-shell CSS rules still overriding the active legacy layout. This hotfix is limited to `desktop/renderer/styles.css` plus continuity so the React shell block only styles descendants inside a visible `#react-root`, leaving the current legacy renderer path stable.
- 2026-04-14: Started issue #380 to restore an actually executable transitional renderer path after the `#352` React shell landed without runtime tooling for JSX or bare React imports. This corrective slice is limited to renderer bootstrap wiring so the desktop falls back to the proven legacy shell until Vite-backed renderer tooling exists.
- 2026-04-19: Started issue #391 on branch `codex/issue-391-v01-scope-freeze` to freeze the Desktop v0.1 April sprint scope, define must-ship vs not-now boundaries, and publish a single release acceptance checklist for 2026-04-30.
- 2026-04-19: Started issue #384 hardening on branch `codex/issue-384-runtime-safety-gate` to extend desktop smoke with renderer safety gates (`rendererMode`, `domReady`, `workbenchReady`) so placeholder/half-rendered shells fail fast instead of passing bridge-only checks.
- 2026-04-17: Started issue #389 after the Vite-backed React runtime became the active shell but no longer exposed a usable workstation. This slice is limited to restoring the legacy shell as the default desktop entrypoint while preserving the Vite/React runtime behind an explicit renderer mode for staged migration.
- 2026-04-19: Completed issue #392 on branch `codex/issue-392-happy-path-gate` by extending smoke with explicit happy-path readiness checks (Runs, Run Detail, Artifacts, Candidates, Compare/guard), updating smoke contracts, and keeping fallback/real-path validation strict on non-breaking operator flow.
- 2026-04-19: Completed issue #393 on branch `codex/issue-393-runtime-state-clarity` by clarifying local-only/degraded runtime messaging, marking Launch browser access as transitional, and tightening System/Paper Ops degraded-state copy without changing core desktop behavior.
