# Decision Log — QuantLab

This document records key architectural and workflow decisions.

The goal is to prevent architectural drift and ensure continuity between development sessions.

Each entry includes:

- context
- decision
- consequences

# 2026-03-10 — CLI-first architecture

## Context

QuantLab is evolving as a research environment for quantitative strategies.

It could naturally drift toward API layers, services, or platform-style infrastructure.

However, this would introduce unnecessary complexity at the current stage.

## Decision

QuantLab will remain **CLI-first**.

The system will be designed primarily for command-line execution and batch experiments.

## Consequences

- no service layer
- no web API
- no microservices
- workflows centered around CLI commands and artifacts

---

# 2026-03-10 — Branch-first development workflow

## Context

Development involves collaboration between ChatGPT (architecture/design) and Antigravity (execution).

To avoid instability in the repository, changes must be isolated.

## Decision

All work must occur in **dedicated branches**.

Direct commits to `main` are prohibited.

## Consequences

- every change occurs through a branch
- pull requests are the integration mechanism
- main branch remains stable

# 2026-03-23 — `.agents` treated as shared repo context for Codex

## Context

The repository memory under `.agents/` was originally phrased around a ChatGPT plus Antigravity split.

Codex now works directly inside the repository and benefits from the same architecture, workflow, and contract context.

## Decision

`.agents/` should be treated as **shared repository context** that is directly consumable by Codex.

Agent-specific phrasing should prefer:

- Codex explicitly, when guidance is Codex-specific
- execution agent generically, when the rule should apply to any implementation agent

## Consequences

- workflow files should not depend on a ChatGPT versus Antigravity split
- Codex can use `.agents/` as a first-class operating handbook
- prompt files may coexist, but Codex should have a dedicated prompt entry

# 2026-03-10 — QuantLab as a research laboratory

## Context

QuantLab could evolve toward a live trading platform.

However the current objective is research and experimentation.

## Decision

QuantLab is defined as a **quantitative research laboratory**, not a trading platform.

## Consequences

- focus on experimentation
- reproducible experiments
- strong reporting
- forward evaluation before any live execution

---

# 2026-04-14 — Desktop target architecture and shared contract guardrails

## Context

Desktop migration is now active across shared contracts, shell bootstrap, preload, and future renderer migration.

Without a fixed target architecture, later slices would keep reopening the same questions about:

- whether the desktop stays browser-first
- whether `research_ui` remains permanent
- whether cross-process payloads can stay ad hoc
- whether the workstation can drift away from engine-owned truth

## Decision

QuantLab Desktop will move toward a native operator workspace with:

- Electron shell as the host runtime
- typed preload plus stable IPC as the shell boundary
- `desktop/shared/` as the only owned cross-process contract layer
- native workstation surfaces as the target UI

`research_ui` is explicitly transitional continuity, not the target shell architecture.

## Consequences

- desktop slices can now stay focused on implementation rather than reopening stack debates
- renderer and shell work must consume shared contracts instead of inventing local payload shapes
- the engine remains authoritative for artifacts, execution semantics, and promotion truth

# 2026-07-26 — Quantitative artifact authority is derived and fail-closed

## Context

Structural JSON versions did not identify the mathematical policies used to
produce metrics. Parseable historical artifacts could therefore enter
ranking, forward selection, or promotion without recognized quantitative
provenance.

## Decision

New quantitative artifacts publish one shared calculation contract, compound
identity, canonical metric payload, and SHA-256 evidence digest. A shared
resolver derives `current`, `superseded`, or `unknown_provenance` using fixed
precedence and an optional non-destructive exact-match supersession registry.

## Consequences

- legacy and superseded evidence remains visible and immutable
- only `current` evidence enters normal ranking, comparison, forward
  selection, or promotion
- malformed or ambiguous authority data fails closed
- historical classification and regeneration remain separate operational
  work and do not modify existing artifacts in this slice
